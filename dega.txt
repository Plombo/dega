                 it's all just a little bit of history repeating...

    Dega is a Sega Master System / Mark III / Game Gear emulator, and runs
    under Windows 95,NT,98,2000,ME or XP and *NIX.

    The old standard disclaimer:

                                What's New?

  v1.16
  + Movie file format altered to record whether this is a Game Gear game
  + Now uses ROM file header rather than file extension to determine
    game type
  + Added optional new portable Z80 core from Final Burn Alpha (originally MAME)
  + Fixed a number of emulation bugs affecting a variety of games
  + Fixed flickering issue with SDL version affecting games which change the
    palette during the frame
  + degavi ported to Windows using VfW
  + Windows: act more friendly to the CPU by not busy looping

  v1.15
  + Fixed emulation bugs affecting Rygar and Golden Axe Warrior
  + Saving/loading of memory watch list (courtesy Alden Sliter)

  v1.14a
  + Overlays now work on Windows Vista

  v1.14
  + User interface improvements
  + Python scripting interface
  + Memory viewer/trainer
  + Support for player 2 input
  + Fixed size scaling options: 1x/2x/3x/4x

  v1.13a
  + Fixed emulation bug for certain games which would incorrectly determine
  the region

  v1.13
  + Bulletproof rerecording with read-only mode
  + AVI encoding from a movie file (*NIX only)
  + Hotkey configuration (Windows only)
  + Information display (frame counter and button input)
  + Slow motion/fast forward
  + Save state slots (Windows only)
  + Auto-fire/auto-hold (Windows only)
  + Frame advance now advances 1 frame rather than 2 (Windows)

  v1.12
  + Added a setting in dega.ini called StartInFullscreen. If set to one, Dega will
  start in fullscreen (may be useful for game launchers).

  v1.11
  (+ might have fixed a potential crash on exit)

  v1.09
  + Added support for loading from .ZIP files (a much requested feature!)

  v1.08
  + Added reverb effect to channels 0 and 1 in Enhanced PSG mode (sounds better).

  v1.07
  + Added native Dega save state format, .dgz
    These save states are GZip compressed and also store the FM chip state.
    To load and save in .dgz format, use Load State and Save State.
    This format is also used for the auto save/load function.
    To import and export in Meka's .s00 save state format, use Import Meka and Export Meka.
  * Changed the window sizing routine since it was changing a bit too much, now the
    window is just simply 3/4 of the desktop space.

  v1.06
  + Added VGM sound logging.
    VGM is a sound format that Zoop and I have come up with for logging sound on various
    consoles. It is like GYM, CYM and SSL except the accuracy can be stepped up to
    44.1khz sample accuracy if voices or other sampled sounds are used.

  + Added .PNG screenshot saving (F12). Screenshots are saved to a "shots" subdirectory.
  * (Changed Start button to C, this was to stop the game pausing when you press
     enter to okay a dialog.)
  + Added Pause function
  + Added frame advance function
  + Fixed Ghouls 'N Ghosts (sprite offset)
  + Changed volume table based on Maxim's real SMS experiments
  + Added a disable switch for the Red/Blue mode (e.g. for playing 3D games in 2D mode)
  + Noise channel is now rendered using pseudo-random numbers.
    (hiss is XOR with 0x12000 and buzz is XOR with 0x10000)
    Both use 0x0001 as the seed, which is reloaded when the noise type
    is written to.

                                How to use

  Run the emulator and select Load Rom from the File menu.
  Select a rom and click open.  Default key assignments are:

  Up,Down,Left,Right = Cursor keys (not on the numpad)
  Fire 1,Fire 2      = Z,X
  Pause/Start        = C
  (On the Master System, the "Start" button was just the fire button.)

  Pause              = P
  Frame Advance      = O
  Choose Slot 0..9   = 0..9
  Quick Load         = F5
  Quick Save         = F6
  Speed Up           = +
  Slow Down          = -
  Fast Forward       = F8

  To toggle the emulator menu, press Escape or the right mouse button.

                                Rerecording

  Dega allows you to record a movie and resume recording it later on.
  To resume recording, start playing a movie, then load a state file that
  was created either during playback or recording of the same movie.
  Recording then resumes at the point when the state was saved.

  If you have selected read-only mode, loading a movie state file will
  resume playback from that point.

  Movie files created with old versions of Dega may need to be updated to
  the newest format.  The mmvconv program is provided for this purpose.
  To use it, issue the command

    mmvconv file.mmv

  Windows users may drag their movie file onto the mmvconv.exe executable.

                             Python scripting

  Dega supports Python scripting of user input (most useful for creating
  bots), resets, movie playback/recording and provides Python access to
  the running game's RAM.  The Python support may be used in standalone
  or embedded mode.  Standalone mode allows you to use the emulator as a
  module in a standalone Python program.  In embedded mode, the Python
  script is loaded and run from within a running emulator.  Both modes
  have the same level of access to the emulator's internal state.
  An example Python script, memory.py, is included with the distribution;
  it is Dega's memory viewer and trainer, fully implemented in Python.
  Further documentation on the Python interface is provided within the
  source code ;)

                               The FM Chip

  Some Japanese machines were equipped with a Yamaha 2413 FM sound chip.
  Select the "FM Chip" option from the menu to enable it.
  However please note that some games will only use the chip if both
  "Japan" and "FM Chip" are selected in the menu.

____________________________________________________________________________________

                               Red/Blue 3D

  If the Red/Blue 3D option is ticked, Dega will take the original flickering
  glasses effect used on some games and merge the images into a Red/Blue image,
  suitable for viewing with Red/Blue glasses.
  Note that not all PC modes can do this (e.g. YUV overlay modes), because YUV doesn't
  have separate Red/Blue channels.

____________________________________________________________________________________

                             Overlay details

  If Overlay is set to None, Dega will use a normal DirectDraw surface to render
  graphics to. All modes are supported except 256-color.

  If Overlay is set to YUV, Dega will try to make a triple-buffered YUV Overlay surface.
  If it can't, it will use a normal surface.

  If Overlay is set to RGB (the default), Dega will try to make a triple-buffered
  RGB Overlay surface. If it can't, it will try a YUV surface, and if that fails
  it will use a normal surface.
